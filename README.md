# 🧩 **Advanced iOS Application – README**

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the **Advanced iOS Mobile Application** developed as part of **SE4041 – Mobile Application Design and Development** for **Semester 2, 2025**.

The app is built using **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, modern iOS frameworks, and incorporates an **emerging technology** (such as Machine Learning, AR, IoT, or HealthKit) to enhance real-world usability.

---

# 📱 **1. Purpose & Target Audience**

### **Purpose**

* Clearly define the problem your app solves or the unique service it provides.
* Explain how the app provides value by addressing a real-world need.

### **Target Audience**

* Identify the primary users of your app.
* Justify the design and feature decisions based on the needs of this audience.

---

# 🎨 **2. Advanced UI Elements**

The app integrates advanced UI and UX features, including:

* Custom animations & transitions
* Gesture recognizers (swipe, drag, long-press, etc.)
* Adaptive & responsive layouts
* Smooth navigation and intuitive user flow

The user interface has been built to support multiple device types and orientations.

---

# 🧱 **3. SwiftUI Components & Customization**

This app uses a wide range of **SwiftUI components** with advanced customization, theming, and styling.

Includes:

* Customized SwiftUI controls
* At least **one custom view modifier** or **custom component**
* Dark Mode compatibility

---

# 🧭 **4. Navigation & Architecture**

The application follows a robust architectural pattern and clean navigation structure using:

* `NavigationStack`
* Modularized view layers
* Data-driven navigation where appropriate

---

# 💾 **5. Data Persistence & Networking**

The app integrates persistent data storage using one of the following:

* **Core Data**
* **Realm**
* **File-based persistent store**

Networking (if used) follows best practices for:

* Asynchronous data loading
* Error handling
* API response management

---

# 🚀 **6. Integration of Emerging Technology**

The app incorporates at least one modern iOS library/framework to enhance functionality.

Possible technologies include:

* **Machine Learning (CoreML)**
* **Augmented Reality (ARKit)**
* **Maps / Location Services**
* **Health & Fitness (HealthKit)**
* **Game Development (SpriteKit / RealityKit)**
* **Education APIs**
* **Localization Frameworks**
